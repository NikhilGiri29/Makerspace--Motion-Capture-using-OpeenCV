## Motion Capture and transfer using CV

##### -->By Nikhil Giri


Makerspace is a novel initiative taken by the Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur to promote the culture of working on robotics-related projects among the students of IIT Kharagpur.  This repsoitory consists of my works for the Makerspace 2021, as part of the Motion Capture and transfer using CV.

I have done 2 Projects with different types of game control using Hand Detection via OpenCV and Mediapipe.

- Snakes (Made in Pygame) control via detection of the direction in which the hand is pointing.
- Online Multiplayer game (SmashKarts) control via detection of whether certain fingers are opened or closed.
