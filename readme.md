# Makerspace 2021
## Motion Capture and transfer using CV

##### -->By Nikhil Giri


Makerspace is a novel initiative taken by the Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur to promote the culture of working on robotics-related projects among the students of IIT Kharagpur.  This repsoitory consists of my works for the Makerspace 2021, as part of the Motion Capture and transfer using CV.

I have done 2 Projects with different types of game control using Hand Detection via OpenCV and Mediapipe.

- Snakes (Made in Pygame) control via detection of the direction in which the hand is pointing.
- Online Multiplayer game (SmashKarts) control via detection of whether certain fingers are opened or closed.


The entire project was very fun to do as I got to explore a lot of new concepts and learn lots of new things. Along with these, it was interesting to come up with my own solutions for various problems and debug the code. Though the image processing requires great hardware to work seamlessly it is a great alternative to standard gameplay and fun to interact with.
